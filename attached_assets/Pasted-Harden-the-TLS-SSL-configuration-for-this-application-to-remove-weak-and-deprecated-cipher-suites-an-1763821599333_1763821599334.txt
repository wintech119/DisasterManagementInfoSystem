Harden the TLS/SSL configuration for this application to remove weak and deprecated cipher suites and protocols, without breaking any existing code, logic, workflows, behaviour, UI, or database schema.

The goal is to ensure the app meets modern cybersecurity standards and eliminates support for weak ciphers, SHA-1, and RSA key exchange.

Requirements

Remove RSA key-exchange ciphers (ROBOT risk)

Disable all RSA key exchange cipher suites, especially:

TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA

And any other TLS_RSA_* suites.

Configure the TLS stack (web server / reverse proxy / load balancer / hosting TLS settings) to use only ECDHE-based key exchange (e.g. ECDHE_RSA, ECDHE_ECDSA).

Enforce strong protocols with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS)

Only allow:

TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3.

Explicitly disable:

TLS 1.0

TLS 1.1

Cipher suites must provide Perfect Forward Secrecy, e.g.:

TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256

TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

TLS 1.3 defaults (e.g. AES-GCM and CHACHA20-POLY1305).

Remove all SHA-1-based cipher suites

Completely remove any cipher suites that use SHA-1, including but not limited to:

..._SHA

Only allow suites using SHA-256 or stronger (e.g. ..._SHA256, ..._SHA384) and TLS 1.3 modern AEAD ciphers.

Maintain compatibility (no breakage)

These changes must not:

Change any application code, routes, logic, workflows, or business rules.

Modify any database schema, tables, columns, triggers, or data.

Break existing API endpoints or web UI behaviour.

Ensure that:

Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) and typical client libraries can still successfully connect.

Existing integrations that already support TLS 1.2+ continue to work.

Implementation scope

Apply these changes in the TLS/SSL configuration layer only, e.g.:

Web server (Nginx, Apache, Caddy, etc.)

Reverse proxy or load balancer

Hosting provider TLS configuration

Do not change application-level code unless absolutely required for compatibility, and even then, preserve all logic and workflows.

Validation / Outcome

After the change:

Security scans must show:

No TLS_RSA_* cipher suites enabled.

No SHA-1 cipher suites enabled.

Only TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 enabled.

Cipher suites in use provide Perfect Forward Secrecy.

The application must behave exactly as before from a functional/user perspective, with the only difference being stronger TLS/SSL security.
