Update the DRIMS app with the following changes, without breaking any existing workflow, UI layout, business logic, security fixes, or database schema:

Money format for all cost fields

For all cost-related fields across the application (e.g. tot_item_cost, unit_cost, addon_cost, any other cost/amount fields in donations, donation items, inventory, requests, etc.):

Enforce money formatting in the UI as the user types or on blur, using the pattern:

Example: $1,000.00

Always include:

Leading currency symbol ($)

Thousand separators (,)

Exactly two decimal places

Ensure that whatever formatting is applied in the frontend, the underlying value saved to the database remains valid numeric/decimal and consistent with the existing schema and server-side validation.

If there is already any utility or helper in the codebase for currency formatting, reuse it instead of adding a new library. If a new helper is needed, implement it in a clean, reusable way and apply it to all cost fields used in donation and donation items entry, as well as any other relevant forms.

Clear placeholder text on focus for cost fields

For all cost-related input fields that have placeholder text (e.g. “Enter cost”, “0.00”, “$0.00”, etc.):

When the user clicks/focuses into the field, the placeholder should be cleared so the user sees an empty field and can type immediately.

When the user leaves the field (blur event):

If they entered a value, format it using the money format described above.

If they left it blank, restore the placeholder (if applicable) and keep the stored value as NULL/empty according to existing rules.

Do not change any validation rules or database constraints—just adjust the frontend behavior and formatting.

Remove the “cost definition” block from Donation Items section (Accept Donation)

In the Donation Items section on the Accept Donation workflow/page, remove the cost definition block that explains what the different cost fields mean (e.g. any explanatory panel, legend, or definition box related to costs).

Only remove the definition/explanation block—do not remove or hide any actual cost input fields, labels, or existing validation.

Ensure the layout still looks clean and aligned after removing this block (no awkward white spaces or broken grid/columns).

General constraints

Do not modify any database tables, columns, constraints, indexes, or triggers.

Do not alter existing business logic for how costs are calculated, stored, or validated on the backend.

Do not change any security-related code (CSP, headers, CSRF, auth, permissions, etc.).

Keep the existing UI style and components consistent (forms, buttons, spacing), only adjusting what is necessary to:

enforce money formatting,

clear placeholders on focus, and
