Fix the issue where email addresses are exposed directly on pages, creating a harvesting risk, without breaking any existing code, logic, workflows, behaviour, UI, or database schema.

Goal

Prevent email harvesting by removing or obfuscating exposed email addresses on public-facing pages.

Keep all current contact flows and responsibilities intact.

Requirements

Identify exposed email addresses

Search all templates, pages, and static content for hard-coded email addresses, especially on:

Public pages (home, about, help, contact, footer, etc.).

Any page not behind authentication.

There are at least 4 instances based on the evidence; find and fix all of them.

Replace direct email text with safer alternatives
For each exposed email:

Prefer one of the following approaches (whichever keeps the current behaviour but reduces harvesting risk):

Option A – Contact form instead of direct email:

Replace visible email@domain.com with:

A “Contact Us” link or button that opens a contact form.

The form should submit to the existing backend handler if one exists, or a simple new handler, without changing any existing workflows that rely on email contact.

Option B – Obfuscate the email

If the email must remain visible for users:

Use text-based obfuscation, e.g.:

support [at] example [dot] gov [dot] jm

Or use minimal JavaScript obfuscation that:

Builds the email string in the browser.

Still renders a clickable mailto: link for users.

Do not break any styling or layout.

Do NOT break existing behaviour

Do NOT:

Change any business logic, workflows, or approval flows.

Modify any database schema, tables, columns, triggers, or stored data.

Break any existing links that are required for logged-in users or internal flows.

Users must still:

Be able to contact the right role/team (same addresses, just safer).

See clear guidance on how to get support.

Scope

Focus on publicly accessible pages where email addresses are exposed to unauthenticated users and bots.

If any email must remain exactly as-is for internal/admin pages behind login, you may leave those unchanged (lower harvesting risk), but public ones must be fixed.

Validation / Outcome

After implementation:

Security scan should no longer detect raw email patterns on public pages.

All contact flows must still work (users can still reach support/ODPEM/JAMICTA/etc.).

No change to existing code logic, workflows, routing, or database behaviour; only the presentation/obfuscation of the email addresses is changed.

Use this prompt to refactor the templates so emails are no longer trivially harvestable, while all real-world contact behaviour remains the same.
