Update the application so that sensitive body parameters are no longer accepted through the query string, and are only processed when sent in the POST body.
This change must be implemented without breaking any existing system behaviour, workflows, business rules, UI, or database schema.

Requirements

Disallow sensitive parameters in the query string

Identify all routes where sensitive data is currently accepted via query parameters (example: passwords, tokens, personal info, IDs, form submissions, donation details, request details, etc.).

Reject or ignore these sensitive fields when supplied through GET query parameters.

Sensitive fields must only be processed when delivered via:

POST request body (e.g., form data, JSON body).

If a user or integration accidentally uses a GET request, the system should:

Return a safe, generic message OR

Redirect them to the correct POST form

But do NOT reveal sensitive details.

No breaking changes to existing logic

Do NOT modify:

Database schema, tables, columns, triggers, or data.

Business logic, roles, or workflows (e.g., donation workflow, relief request workflow, dispatch, packaging, approvals, etc.).

Authentication behaviour.

Any front-end UI or flow.

Ensure:

Existing forms that already submit via POST continue to work exactly the same.

No page, redirect, or action breaks as a result of enforcing POST-only semantics.

Implementation method

Use one safe, centralized method:

Add a request validation layer, middleware, or decorator that:

Checks for sensitive parameters in request.args (query string).

Ignores or blocks them with a secure response.

Allows normal POST-based flow to continue unchanged.

If framework allows, configure routes to explicitly force:

methods=["POST"] for sensitive operations.

Compatibility

Ensure all existing frontend forms are already using POST.

If any form incorrectly uses GET, update it to POST without altering:

Field names

Logic

Validation

Workflows

Redirects

Validation / Outcome

After implementation:

Security scan must confirm:

Sensitive data can no longer be passed through the query string.

Sensitive parameters in GET requests are ignored or rejected safely.

All workflows must continue functioning exactly as before.

No regression in login, donations, relief requests, dispatch, approvals, dashboards, etc.
