Update the existing Donation Acceptance / Add Donation Item functionality so that the Quantity field behaves differently for FUNDS vs GOODS, without breaking anything else in the system.

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS
- Do NOT change:
  - Any database schema (no new columns, no alters, no drops).
  - Any existing routes, templates, menus, navigation, or page layout.
  - Any existing workflows, security fixes, CSP, auth, or role checks.
- Only adjust the logic for how the Quantity field behaves on the existing Donation Items section of the donation acceptance page.

REQUIREMENT
When a user is accepting a donation and adding donation items:

1. Determine the category type of the selected item:
   - From the existing relationship item.category_id → itemcatg.category_id → itemcatg.category_type.
   - category_type can be 'GOODS' or 'FUNDS'.

2. Behaviour when category_type = 'FUNDS':
   - The Quantity field in the Donation Items block must:
     • Default to 1.00 when the item is selected.
     • Be displayed as read-only / disabled so the user cannot change it.
   - In the UI, the user should clearly see “1.00” as the quantity, but they must not be able to edit it.
   - On form submit, the backend must always treat FUNDS items as:
     • donation_item.item_qty = 1.00
     • Even if a malicious user tries to tamper with the request, the server-side logic must override any incoming quantity for FUNDS and force item_qty to 1.00.
   - All other fields (Item, Type, Location, Item Cost, UOM, Comments, etc.) must continue to behave exactly as they do now.

3. Behaviour when category_type = 'GOODS':
   - Keep the current behaviour exactly as it is:
     • Quantity should default to 1.00 (as it does now).
     • Quantity must remain editable by the user.
   - No changes to any validation rules for GOODS quantities.

4. General:
   - Do not alter any existing validations unrelated to this rule.
   - Do not introduce any visual regressions to the Donation Items section.
   - Ensure the change works for both Create and Edit of donation items.
   - Ensure that all current business rules, security checks, and database constraints continue to pass.

In summary:
- FUNDS items → Quantity is fixed at 1.00 (default + non-editable, enforced in both UI and backend).
- GOODS items → Quantity behaves exactly as it does today.
Implement this using the existing code structure and patterns without breaking anything else.
