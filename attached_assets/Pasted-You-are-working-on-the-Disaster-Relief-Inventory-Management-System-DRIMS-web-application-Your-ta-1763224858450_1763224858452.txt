You are working on the Disaster Relief Inventory Management System (DRIMS) web application.

Your task is to make the entire application fully responsive for all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile phones), following modern best practices and international standards (including WCAG 2.1).

1. General Requirements

The UI must adapt gracefully to:

Small phones (< 480px)

Regular phones (480–767px)

Tablets (768–1024px, portrait & landscape)

Desktop / large screens (> 1024px)

Do not break or significantly change the current desktop layout. Desktop remains the primary reference; smaller breakpoints should adapt from it.

Use responsive CSS (Bootstrap grid / flexbox / CSS Grid + media queries) instead of fixed pixel layouts.

2. Layout & Navigation

Sidebar / Left Menu

On desktop: keep the current vertical sidebar.

On tablet/phone:

Collapse the sidebar into a hamburger menu at the top-left.

The menu opens as an overlay or slide-out panel.

Ensure it is keyboard accessible and closable (Esc / close button).

Avoid horizontal scrolling caused by the sidebar on small screens.

Top bar / headers

Ensure titles and actions (e.g., Back button, user profile) reflow nicely:

Stack vertically on small screens if necessary.

Buttons should wrap instead of being cut off.

Content area

Use responsive containers:

Cards and panels should stack vertically on small screens.

Avoid fixed widths; use percentage or max-width where possible.

3. Key Screens to Make Responsive

Apply proper responsive behaviour to all major DRIMS screens, including but not limited to:

Dashboards (Admin, Logistics, Agency, etc.)

Needs Lists screens (list, prepare fulfilment, review, completed)

Relief Requests & Relief Packages (list, create/edit, prepare package)

Inventory pages (view, receive, transfer)

Management pages (warehouses, items, locations, agencies, events, donors, custodians)

User/profile/settings screens.

For each page:

Cards: stack into a single column on narrow screens.

Two-column layouts (main + right workflow/notes panel):

On desktop: side-by-side.

On tablet/phone: stack main content first, then workflow/notes below.

Tables:

Allow horizontal scrolling on small screens instead of squashing columns.

Optionally use a responsive pattern (e.g., table-responsive wrapper) so columns don’t break.

4. Forms & Inputs

All forms must:

Use responsive grid or full-width inputs on small screens.

Prevent labels and inputs from being truncated.

Keep a minimum tappable size of ~44x44px for buttons and important controls (WCAG).

For numeric inputs (e.g., allocations):

Ensure they fit on small screens without clipping spinner arrows or overlapping text.

5. Accessibility & International Standards

Follow WCAG 2.1 AA where practical:

Text must remain readable on small screens:

Avoid font sizes smaller than ~14px on mobile.

Maintain sufficient contrast for text and icons.

All interactive elements must:

Be reachable via keyboard (Tab order preserved).

Have visible focus outlines.

Ensure that:

No critical content requires horizontal scrolling on mobile (except wide tables in a scroll container).

Zooming is not disabled (meta viewport should allow zoom).

6. Technical Implementation Details

Use or extend existing CSS framework (e.g., Bootstrap) and utilities:

Prefer responsive classes like col-md-6, col-lg-4, etc.

Add media queries for breakpoints:

e.g., @media (max-width: 767.98px) { ... } for phones.

e.g., @media (max-width: 991.98px) { ... } for tablets.

Refactor any fixed-width elements (e.g., width: 1200px) into fluid or max-widths.

Wrap tables in a responsive container:
class="table-responsive" or equivalent custom CSS.

7. Testing & Verification

Test the application in the browser dev tools using:

iPhone SE / iPhone 13

Small Android phone

iPad (portrait & landscape)

Standard laptop/desktop widths.

Fix any layout issues like:

Clipped text.

Overlapping controls.

Menus or dialogs going off-screen.

Horizontal scrollbars caused by layout, not tables.

8. Deliverable

Produce the necessary CSS/SCSS updates, layout tweaks, and component adjustments so that all DRIMS pages are mobile-friendly and responsive across phones and tablets, while preserving the existing desktop design and WCAG-aligned usability.
