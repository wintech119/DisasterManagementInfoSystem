Harden the HTTP response headers by removing or sanitizing unnecessary headers that leak technology/stack details, without breaking any existing code, logic, workflows, behaviour, UI, or database schema.

Goal

Prevent attackers from easily fingerprinting the tech stack by exposing framework, server, or version info in HTTP response headers.

Requirements

Identify and clean up info-leaking headers

Find and either remove or neutralize headers such as (examples, adjust to what exists now):

Server

X-Powered-By

X-AspNet-Version

X-AspNetMvc-Version

Any custom headers that reveal:

Framework names

Versions

Internal infrastructure details

For each:

Prefer removing the header entirely.

If removal is not possible, sanitize it to a generic non-sensitive value (e.g., Server: secure), with no version numbers.

No breaking changes

Do NOT:

Change any application logic, routes, controllers, or services.

Modify any business workflows or role behaviours.

Change any authentication, authorization, or session handling.

Modify any database schema, tables, columns, triggers, or data.

Only adjust the HTTP headers at the framework or web server level.

Implementation scope

Apply changes in one centralized place such as:

Web framework global response hook (e.g., Flask after_request, Express middleware, Django middleware).

Web server / reverse proxy config (e.g., Nginx, Apache) if that’s where these headers are set.

Hosting-level config (e.g., platform setting for Server / X-Powered-By).

Ensure all responses (HTML, JSON, API, etc.) benefit from this hardening.

Preserve required/standard headers

Do not remove or alter essential headers that affect normal operation, such as:

Content-Type

Content-Length

Set-Cookie

CORS headers (if configured)

Security headers already implemented (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.)

Validation / Outcome

After implementation:

Security scans must show:

Previously flagged “unnecessary / info-leaking headers” are removed or sanitized.

The application must behave exactly the same from a user perspective:

All pages load correctly.

All APIs work as before.

No UI or workflow regression.
